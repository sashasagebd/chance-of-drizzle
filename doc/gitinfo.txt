.gitignore:
    Contains folders + files that shouldn't be put in the repository, I just used a standard unity template

NOTES:
    -Since we are just using one branch, make sure to keep your work in your folder
    -Unity will automatically generate the files in the .gitignore when you open the project
    -To get set up, clone the repo then add project from disk to launch in unity
    -prefabs: reusable game object
    -src: C# scripts
    -tst: testing
    -.meta files are autogenerated by unity and needed for it to know where everything is
