Prefab: Goal

A goal which goes to the next scene when the player reaches it.

To spawn a goal, drag the prefab into the scene.

The goal prefab comes with a single script, GoalPoint.cs.

It contains one public static method:
  void setExitDestination(string sceneName)
    sceneName: the name of the scene to go to
